#Single-Threaded Nature of Node.js:
Node.js is single-threaded, meaning it operates on a single thread in the event loop. This allows for non-blocking I/O operations, making it efficient for handling asynchronous tasks. However, if one operation blocks the thread, it can slow down the entire server.

Here's a simple example to illustrate how Node.js's single-threaded nature works:


#The header tells the server details about the request such as what type of data the client, user, or request wants in the response. Type can be html , text , JSON , cookies or others.
